			<h1><center>Here are the most common types of doctors you'll likely see.</center></h1>
		

		<h2>Allergists/Immunologists</h2>
		<p>They treat immune system disorders such as asthma, eczema, food
			allergies, insect sting allergies, and some autoimmune diseases.</p>
		<h2>Anesthesiologists</h2>
		<p>These doctors give you drugs to numb your pain or to put you
			under during surgery, childbirth, or other procedures. They monitor
			your vital signs while you’re under anesthesia.</p>

		<h2>Cardiologists</h2>
		<p>They’re experts on the heart and blood vessels. You might see
			them for heart failure, a heart attack, high blood pressure, or an
			irregular heartbeat.</p>

		<h2>Dermatologists</h2>
		<p>Have problems with your skin, hair, nails? Do you have moles,
			scars, acne, or skin allergies? Dermatologists can help.</p>



		<h2>Hematologists</h2>
		<p>These are specialists in diseases of the blood, spleen, and
			lymph glands, like sickle cell disease, anemia, hemophilia, and
			leukemia.</p>

		<h2>Infectious Disease Specialists</h2>
		<p>They diagnose and treat infections in any part of your body,
			like fevers, Lyme disease, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and HIV and AIDS.
			Some of them specialize in preventive medicine or travel medicine.</p>



		<h2>Nephrologists</h2>
		<p>They treat kidney diseases as well as high blood pressure and
			fluid and mineral imbalances linked to kidney disease.</p>

		<h2>Neurologists</h2>
		<p>These are specialists in the nervous system, which includes the
			brain, spinal cord, and nerves. They treat strokes, brain and spinal
			tumors, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

		<h2>Obstetricians and Gynecologists</h2>
		<p>Often called OB/GYNs, these doctors focus on women's health,
			including pregnancy and childbirth. They do Pap smears, pelvic exams,
			and pregnancy checkups. OB/GYNs are trained in both areas. But some
			of them may focus on women's reproductive health (gynecologists), and
			others specialize in caring for pregnant women (obstetricians).</p>

		<h2>Oncologists</h2>
		<p>These internists are cancer specialists. They do chemotherapy
			treatments and often work with radiation oncologists and surgeons to
			care for someone with cancer.</p>

		<h2>Ophthalmologists</h2>
		<p>You call them eye doctors. They can prescribe glasses or
			contact lenses and diagnose and treat diseases like glaucoma. Unlike
			optometrists, they’re medical doctors who can treat every kind of eye
			condition as well as operate on the eyes.</p>

		<h2>Pathologists</h2>
		<p>These lab doctors identify the causes of diseases by examining
			body tissues and fluids under microscopes.</p>

		<h2>Pediatricians</h2>
		<p>They care for children from birth to young adulthood. Some
			pediatricians specialize in pre-teens and teens, child abuse, or
			children's developmental issues.</p>

		<h2>Physiatrists</h2>
		<p>These specialists in physical medicine and rehabilitation treat
			neck or back pain and sports or spinal cord injuries as well as other
			disabilities caused by accidents or diseases.</p>

		<h2>Plastic Surgeons</h2>
		<p>You might call them cosmetic surgeons. They rebuild or repair
			your skin, face, hands, breasts, or body. That can happen after an
			injury or disease or for cosmetic reasons.</p>


		<h2>Psychiatrists</h2>
		<p>These doctors work with people with mental, emotional, or
			addictive disorders. They can diagnose and treat depression,
			schizophrenia, substance abuse, anxiety disorders, and sexual and
			gender identity issues. Some psychiatrists focus on children,
			adolescents, or the elderly.</p>

		<h2>Pulmonologists</h2>
		<p>You would see these specialists for problems like lung cancer,
			pneumonia, asthma, emphysema, and trouble sleeping caused by
			breathing issues.</p>

		<h2>Radiologists</h2>
		<p>They use X-rays, ultrasound, and other imaging tests to
			diagnose diseases. They can also specialize in radiation oncology to
			treat conditions like cancer.</p>


		<h2>General Surgeons</h2>
		<p>These doctors can operate on all parts of your body. They can
			take out tumors, appendices, or gallbladders and repair hernias. Many
			surgeons have subspecialties, like cancer, hand, or vascular surgery.</p>
